### Message for AI Coding Agents

Thank you for contributing to the development of this project.

This application is a customized version of Open-Interpreter, tailored to meet specific requirements. All metadata, configurations, and documentation should reflect these customizations and must not reference the original Open-Interpreter directly.

As an AI coding agent, your expertise is vital to maintaining the stability, reliability, and functionality of this application. Please ensure that any changes you introduce are thoroughly tested and do not compromise the application's performance or integrity.

This project is currently in its development phase and is intended for internal use only. A comprehensive and refined README will be prepared once the application reaches a stable and production-ready state.

The application entry points are:

*   `tia_interpreter.main.main()`: This is the main entry point when the application is run as a script or via `python -m tia_interpreter`.
*   `tia_interpreter.api.agent_api`: This FastAPI application serves as an API endpoint, likely for external interactions with the agent.
